        <h3>Presentation</h3>
        <p>
            This course is an introduction to the mathematical modeling of random graphs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only a basic probabilistic background is required (finite and countable probability, discrete random variables), making the course accessible to every mathematical student. One of our aims is to illustrate some interesting ideas and techniques of modern probability theory in an accessible and relatively non-technical framework.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            In recent years there has been an increasing interest for real-world networks, such as the internet, collaboration and citation networks, social relations, biological and ecological networks. A remarkable fact is that such different examples show surprisingly similar large-scale features. For instance, these networks are "small worlds", meaning that typical distances among nodes grow slowly with the size of the network, and many of them are "scale free", meaning that the empirical distribution of the degrees (number of nodes connected to a given node) is almost independent of the size of the network, and shows a power-law decay. In order to explain such features, many efforts have been devoted to the study of mathematical models that go under the name of "random graphs".
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the simplest way to produce a random graph, having {1, 2, ..., n} as the sets of nodes, is to toss a coin for each couple (i,j) of nodes, putting a connection between them if a head comes up (the coins are assumed to be independent, and to give head with the same probability p). This model was investigated already in the late 1950s by Erdos and Renyi, who showed that an interesting "phase transition" occurs: depending on how the probability p scales with n, the graph either presents a "giant connected component", of size proportional to n, or it consists of many "small disconnected ilands", of size at most log(n). Despite its apparent simplicity, the fine properties of this model are far from trivial and are amenable to a thorough mathematical analysis. This will be the main object of the first part of the course.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Erdos-Renyi random graph is not a good model for many real-world networks, because it is not scale free. For this reason, in the last decades several alternative models have been proposed and investigated. We will focus on two of the most popular ones: the "configuration model", a random graph model in which the degrees are fixed beforehand and the nodes are connected in the most random way, and the "preferential attachment model", where the graph is built dynamically, adding nodes to the network in a sequential fashion, favoring connections among nodes with large degrees. Both classes of models lead to scale free and small world networks and one can prove precise asymptotic results for the typical distances and degree distributions. This will be the object of the second part of the course.
