        <h2 class="first">An Introduction to Regularity Structures</h2>
        
        <p>Francesco Caravenna</p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            This course is an introduction to the theory of Regularity Structures, one of the 
            greatest achievements of modern stochastic analysis, for which Martin Hairer was 
            awarded the Fields Medal in 2014. This theory allows, for the first time, to give a 
            robust meaning to important PDEs which are classically ill-posed due to the presence 
            of singular terms, such as products of (possibly random) distributions of low 
            regularity. At the heart of the theory lies a far-reaching generalization of the 
            usual Taylor expansions, called modelled distributions, where ordinary monomials can 
            be replaced by distributions of low regularity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The course is thought not only for probability students, but also for students widely 
            interested in analysis and (deterministic!) PDEs. The prerequisite is a basic knowledge 
            in analysis (heat equation, distributions) and probability (Gaussian random 
            variables, independence). Some familiarity with Brownian motion and stochastic 
            integration is welcome, but not required.

        <h3>Lectures Log</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Lecture 1</b> (April 4). Examples of singular equations driven by white noise: KPZ, &Phi;<sup>4</sup><sub>d</sub> with d=2,3, &alpha;-SDE with 1/2 < &alpha; &le; 1. Regularization of the noise and the need for renormalization: statement of the "Main Theorem". - Some key tools: distributions and Holder spaces with negative regularity; white noise and the convolution with the heat kernel. The Da Prato - Debussche argument for &Phi;<sup>4</sup><sub>2</sub>.</li>
            <li><b>Lecture 2</b> (April 11). Reminders on distributions. Convolution with smooth and non smooth functions. Scaled functions and the "Identification Lemma". Holder functions (of positive regularity) revisited. Holder distributions of negative regularity. Wavelets and characterization of Holder distributions.</li>
            <li><b>Lecture 3</b> (April 17). Distributions of finite order: link with negative Holder spaces via scaled functions. Elements of wavelets analysis and links with Holder distributions. The Reconstruction Theorem for a germ (= family of distributions) satisfying 1. bounded order and 2. coherence. Proof using wavelets.</li>
            <li><b>Lecture 4</b> (May 2). Definition of semi-norms for germs and continuity of the Reconstruction Map. An application of the Reconstruction Theorem: the product can be extended to a continuous bi-linear map: <i>C<sup>-a</sup></i> x <i>C<sup>b</sup></i> &rarr; <i>C<sup>-a</sup></i> provided <i>b>a</i>. Introduction to the axioms of Regularity Structures and their Models.</li>
            <li><b>Lecture 5</b> (May 9). Remarks on the non-density of smooth functions in the space <i>C<sup>b</sup></i> and on the extension of the product to a continuous bi-linear map: <i>C<sup>-a</sup></i> x <i>C<sup>b</sup></i> &rarr; <i>C<sup>-a</sup></i> for <i>b>a</i>. Axioms of Regularity Structures and their Models. Examples: the polynomial regularity structure; the rough path regularity structure.</li>
            <li><b>Lecture 6</b> (May 23). Reminders on the axioms of Regularity Structures and their Models. Definition of modelled distributions. The Reconstruction Theorem revisited. Notion of products in Regularity Structure.</li>
            <li><b>Lecture 7</b> (May 30). Reminders on modelled distributions. Topologies on models and modelled distributions, continuity of the Reconstruction Map. Example of a non-standard product. The rough path regularity structure: example of product; rough integral (via RT). The &alpha;-SDE with 1/2 < &alpha; &le; 1 ("rough volatility"): strategy to lift the equation to modelled distribution; definition of the corresponding regularity structure. Introduction to the convolution with singular kernels.</li>
            <li><b>Lecture 8</b> (June 6). The &alpha;-SDE with 1/2 < &alpha; &le; 1 ("rough volatility"). Definition of the regularity structure and of the "continuum model" for &alpha; > 1/4 (using suitable modifications of the Ito integral). Integration w.r.t. the singular kernel and multiplication with the noise at the level of modelled distributions. Solution of the "lifted" SDE as a fixed point in the space of modelled distributions, solved by contraction theorem for small times. Smooth approximations of the canonical model: renormalization is needed to have convergence.</li>
            <li><b>Lecture 9</b> (June 13). The &alpha;-SDE with 1/4 < &alpha; &le; 1 ("rough volatility") revised. For any choice of "admissible" model (i.e. of the product z&xi; for z = K*&xi;), the SDE can be lifted in the space of modelled distribution, where it has a unique solution (the product z&xi; is canonically defined for a class of z wide enough to find a solution). The canonical model from a smooth mollification &xi;<sup>&epsilon;</sup> of &xi; does not converge to the continuum model defined by Ito integration: computation of the renormalization. - Introduction to the analysis of the &Phi;<sup>4</sup><sub>3</sub> equation: symbols of the Regularity Structures, tree notation.</li>
            <li><b>Lecture 10</b> (June 25). Analysis of the &Phi;<sup>4</sup><sub>3</sub> equation: recursive construction of the Regularity Structures (A,T,G) and canonical model (&Pi;,&Gamma;). Space of modelled distribution <i>D</i><sup>&gamma;</sup>(V) with sector V relevant for the solution. Definition of product. Convolution operator <i>K</i> lifted to the space of modelled distribution (sketch). Lift of the &Phi;<sup>4</sup><sub>3</sub> equation to the space of modelled distributions <i>D</i><sup>&gamma;</sup>(V), determination of the exponent &gamma; and relations among the coefficients. Non convergence of the canonical model: diverging expectation of &Pi;(I&Xi;)<sup>2</sup>. Elements of Wiener chaos theory and convergence of the renormalized &Pi;(I&Xi;)<sup>2</sup> - E[&Pi;(I&Xi;)<sup>2</sup>] (sketch).<br>End of the course.</li>
